    NOTE:
        Our algorithm is slightly different from the original one, but the result will be same.
        More details below:
            When we define N = n_independent_runs, K = X.size, and S = n_samples,
            the original algorithm requires O(NK + K log K)
            and this algorithm requires O(NK log K).
            Although our algorithm is a bit worse than the original algorithm,
            since the enumerating Pareto solutions requires O(NS log S),
            which might be smaller complexity but will take more time in Python,
            the time complexity will not dominate the whole process.
